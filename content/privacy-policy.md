## Who we are

This is a personal portfolio/blog run by myself, Chris Bailey. There is no advertising or personalised targeting. None of the data collected on this website is used for advertising, targeting or profiling.

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site wordpress collects the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitorâ€™s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Contact forms

The information included in the contact form is only used so that I can respond to your query. None of this information is used for marketing purposes and you will not be added to any email lists.

### Analytics

This website makes use of Google Analytics, which allows me to see whether or not anyone has actually visited my website. All of this data is aggregated and can not be associated with any individual &#8211; to ensure this, all IP addresses are anonymised before being sent to Google Analytics. 

## Who we share your data with

None of your data will be shared with any third parties.

## How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so wordpress can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

## What rights you have over your data

If you have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data, including any data you have provided on this site. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you.
